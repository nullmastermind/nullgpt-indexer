##### A section of the repository https://github.com/nullmastermind/chatgpt-web is dedicated to providing you with a method to communicate using confidential documentation.


```shell
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

To create an index, create a folder inside the `docs` folder and call the API. Please import `nullgpt_indexer.json` to https://hoppscotch.io/ to see some API examples. Just run and go to https://gpt.dongnv.dev to chat with your private documentation.

Don't forget to create a `.env` file with example content from the `.env.example` file and add the value for `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

### Note:

- `doc_id` is the same as the folder name inside `docs`
