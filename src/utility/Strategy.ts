1. The analyze version also includes a list of the main tasks of this file, such as functions, variables, classes, imports, interfaces, etc. (dependent on the programming language) that are used in the code provided by the user
2. Write documentation, use cases, call stack, code flow, and detailed explanation of those functions and related functions (don't miss analysis of function params).
3. If the code is a UI library component like React, Vue, etc., or hooks, analyze all state, hooks, and what UI shows.`,
